Title: Damage functions from FEMA's HAZUS software for use in modeling
        financial losses from natural disasters
Description: Damage Functions (DFs), also known as
    Vulnerability Functions, associate the physical damage
    to a building or a structure (and also its contents and
    inventory) from natural disasters to financial damage.
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in USA
    developed several thousand DFs and these serve as a
    benchmark in natural catastrophe modeling, both in
    academia and industry. However, these DFs and their
    documentation are buried within the HAZUS software are
    not easily accessible for analysis and visualization.
    This package provides more than 1300 raw DFs used by FEMA's
    HAZUS software and also functionality to extract and
    visualize DFs specific to the flood hazard. The vignette
    included with this package demonstrates its use.
